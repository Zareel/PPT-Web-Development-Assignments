# Q1. What is Primitive and Non-primitive data type in JS? or What is difference between primitive and non-primitive data types? or What is difference between null and undefined data types?

Ans: Every variable has a datatype that tells what kind of data is being stored in the variable. There are two types of data types in JavaScript

- Primitive datatypes : The in-built data types provided by Javascript is known as primitive data types
  eg :

1. number: numbers
2. string: sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes
3. undefined: value is not assinged
4. boolean: true or false
5. null: represents the intensional absence of any object value
6. bigint: represents numeric value which are too big to be represented by number
7. symbol: symbol data type is used to create unique objects

- Non Primitive datatypes: The datatypes that are derived from primitive data types are known as non-primitive data types
  eg:

1. object: enclosed in curly braces and they are in the form of key value pairs
2. array: collection of related data enclosed in the square brackets and seperated by comma

# Q2. What is difference between == and === operators?

- `==` is also known as loose equality operator which is mainly used to compare two values in both sides and then return true or false.
- `===` is also known as strict equality operator. It compares both the values and datatypes

# Q3. Explain the implicit type coercion in javascript.

- implicit type coercion: it is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another data type. eg: `==` operator compares two values only after converting them in to a common type which is known as `type coersion`. In other words `type coersion` means

# Q4. What is a NaN property in JS?

Ans: The NaN global property is a value representing Not-A-Number
The operations that return NaN

- Failed number conversion

# Q5. Explain pass by value and pass by reference in JavaScript.

In JavaScript when a function is called, the arguments can be passed in two ways, either

- pass by value or
- pass by reference(address)
  Primitive datatypes are passed by value and non primitive data types are passed by reference
  Primitive values are stored on the stack and non primitive values are stored in heap
