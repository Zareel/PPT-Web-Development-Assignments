# 5. How many pairs of X and Y are possible in the number 763X4Y2, if the number is divisible by 9?

A number is divisible by 9 if sum of its digits is divisible by 9

Find sum of digits of 763X4Y2

7 + 6 + 3 + X + 4 + Y + 2

= 22 + X + Y

27 and 36 are two possible sum divisible by 9

Case 1: Sum is 27

=> X + Y = 5

Possible Pairs of X and Y

(X , Y) = (0 , 5) , ( 1 , 4) , ( 2 , 3) , ( 3 , 2) , ( 4, 1) , ( 5 , 0)

6 pairs

Case 2: Sum is 36

=> X + Y = 14

Possible Pairs of X and Y

(X , Y) = (5 , 9) , ( 6 , 8) , ( 7 , 7) , ( 8 , 6) , ( 9, 5)

5 Pairs

Total Pairs = 11

Hence 11 pairs of X and Y are possible in the number 763X4Y2, if the number is divisible by 9

# 6. When the integer n is divided by 8, the remainder is 3. What is the remainder if 6n is divided by 8?

Ans: 4

- Case: 1
  if n = 11
  11 / 8 = 1
  remainder = 3
  6n = 66
  66/ 8 = 8
  remainer = 4

- Case: 2
  if n = 27
  27 / 8 = 3
  remainder = 3

6n = 162
162 / 8 = 22
remainder = 4

# 7. If the product 4864 x 9P2 is divisible by 12, then what is the value of P?

# 8. If the number 7X86038 is exactly divisible by 11, then the smallest whole number in place of X?

Ans: X = 9

# 9. If an integer n is divisible by 3, 5 and 12, what is the next larger integer divisible by all these numbers?

Ans: d. n + 60

# 10. What is the product of the largest and the smallest possible values of M for which a number 5M83M4M1 is divisible by 9?

Ans: smallest possible value = 2
largest possible value = 8
product = 16
